    <h2>Our Approach</h2>
    <p>Bankruptcy-driven real estate sales are complex, time-sensitive, and require operators who can close quickly and decisively. We step in with capital readiness and a proven ability to navigate distressed environments — complementing our <a href="/strategies/distressed-assets/">Distressed Asset</a> and <a href="/strategies/assemblage/">Assemblage</a> strategies.</p>

    <div class="feature-block">
      <h3>Proven Track Record</h3>
      <p>With experience across dozens of distressed deals and thousands of underwritings, we know how to bring order to chaos. Bankruptcy transactions reward operators who combine speed with deep diligence — and we’ve built our reputation doing just that. See more in our <a href="/track-record/">Track Record</a>.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="feature-block alt">
      <h3>Our Playbook</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Assess Quickly:</strong> Identify risks, opportunities, and go/no-go decisions fast.</li>
        <li><strong>Certainty of Close:</strong> Deploy capital with firm timelines that meet court and creditor requirements.</li>
        <li><strong>Stabilize & Transition:</strong> Take control of assets, resolve operational friction, and reposition for long-term value — often into <a href="/strategies/commercial-repositioning/">Commercial Repositioning</a> opportunities.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="feature-block">
      <h3>Why It Matters</h3>
      <p>Bankruptcy assets often intimidate traditional buyers. We thrive in these environments — bringing discipline, execution, and speed to situations where most hesitate.</p>

    <p>This vacant warehouse is an example of the type of property that often comes through <strong>bankruptcy proceedings</strong>.
