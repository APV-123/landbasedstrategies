    <p>Capturing resilient demand with climate-controlled and drive-up facilities in Texas growth corridors.</p>
  </div>
</section>

<!-- Main Content -->
<main>
<section>
  <div class="container">
    <h2>Our Approach</h2>
    <p>We pursue self storage in markets where rooftops outpace supply and visibility drives tenant acquisition. Facilities balance <strong>climate-controlled units</strong>, <strong>drive-up access</strong>, and strong branding to generate recurring income and high tenant retention. This strategy delivers durable returns with low operating costs and defensive qualities through cycles.</p>

    <div class="feature-block">
      <h3>Where We Focus</h3>
      <p>Population growth corridors in the <strong>Texas Triangle</strong> — Houston, Dallas–Fort Worth, Austin, and San Antonio — along with suburban and infill locations near retail corridors, highways, and rooftops that drive consistent demand.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="feature-block alt">
      <h3>Execution Levers</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Ground-up development of climate-controlled and drive-up facilities</li>
        <li>Value-add repositioning: upgrading older sites with technology, security, and branding</li>
        <li>Lease-up strategies using digital marketing, dynamic pricing, and cross-selling</li>
        <li>Third-party partnerships with major operators for scalable management</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="feature-block">
      <h3>Proven Playbook</h3>
      <p>Self storage has institutionalized as a core real estate class, offering <strong>sticky demand</strong> driven by life events and small businesses. Ownership fragmentation creates opportunities to consolidate and professionalize assets. We apply the same clarity and discipline from <a href="/deal-studio/">Deal Studio</a> to this sector, ensuring underwriting precision and repeatability.</p>
