<!-- Main Content -->
<main>
<section>
  <div class="container">
    <h2>Our Approach</h2>
    <p>We pursue IOS opportunities in infill and highway-adjacent locations where zoning and barriers to entry create lasting scarcity. These sites generate stable income today and preserve flexibility for future redevelopment or expansion.</p>

    <div class="feature-block">
      <h3>Where We Focus</h3>
      <p>Strategic markets with strong infrastructure connectivity, tenant demand for truck parking or laydown yards, and limited supply of compliant outdoor storage sites.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="feature-block alt">
      <h3>Execution Levers</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Paving, lighting, fencing, and drainage upgrades</li>
        <li>Securing long-term leases with transportation and logistics users</li>
        <li>Stabilizing sites as cash-flowing assets with optionality for redevelopment</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="feature-block">
      <h3>Proven Playbook</h3>
      <p>IOS has rapidly institutionalized as a niche within industrial real estate. We follow the proven model of upgrading underutilized land into stabilized, income-producing sites while maintaining the ability to reposition into higher-and-better uses over time.</p>

    <p>Upgrading land into paved, fenced, and lit IOS facilities creates long-term stability while preserving optionality. These images reflect the modern IOS standard that institutional capital and tenants increasingly demand.</p>

<!-- Value Proposition -->
<section class="value">
  <div class="container">
    <h2>The Value of IOS</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Scarcity:</strong> Infill IOS is scarce due to zoning and permitting restrictions.</li>
      <li><strong>Sticky Tenants:</strong> Trucking, logistics, and contractors often sign long leases for stable storage needs.</li>
      <li><strong>Low Capex:</strong> Paving, lighting, and fencing upgrades create durable yield with limited construction risk.</li>
      <li><strong>Optionality:</strong> Sites can later be redeveloped into higher-and-better uses while generating cash flow today.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>IOS complements our <a href="/strategies/industrial/value-add/">Value-Add Industrial</a> and <a href="/strategies/industrial/ground-up/">Ground-Up Industrial</a> strategies by combining near-term stability with long-term optionality.</p>

<!-- FAQ -->
<section class="container" aria-labelledby="ios-faq">
  <h2 id="ios-faq">IOS — FAQs</h2>
  <div class="card">
    <h3>What types of tenants use IOS?</h3>
    <p>Logistics operators, trucking companies, contractors, and equipment storage users are the primary tenants.</p>
    <h3>Why is IOS scarce?</h3>
    <p>Zoning, stormwater, and permitting restrictions make compliant IOS sites rare in infill and suburban markets.</p>
    <h3>How does IOS fit into your platform?</h3>
    <p>IOS provides near-term cash flow with long-term redevelopment potential, balancing stability and upside.</p>
