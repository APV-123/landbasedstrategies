    <h1>Ground-Up Industrial</h1>
    <p>Delivering Class A industrial where demand outpaces supply — tilt-wall, flex, and logistics space designed for modern tenants across the Texas Triangle.</p>
  </div>
</section>

<!-- Main Content -->

    <h2>Our Approach</h2>
    <p>Ground-up industrial development allows us to create modern facilities that directly align with tenant demand. Where value-add strategies leverage in-place cash flow, ground-up provides blank-slate flexibility — designing tilt-wall distribution centers, flex bays, or light manufacturing facilities tailored to credit tenants.</p>
    <p>This strategy carries higher risk than value-add, given the absence of existing income during construction. But the payoff is long-term durability, premium rents, and tenant stickiness created by customized design and market-leading functionality.</p>

    <div class="feature-block">
      <h3>Where We Focus</h3>
      <p>Sites with strong highway access, labor pool proximity, and zoning support for industrial use. We prioritize infill parcels where supply is constrained and suburban growth corridors where demand is accelerating.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="feature-block alt">
      <h3>Execution Levers</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Site selection with zoning, access, and utility readiness</li>
        <li>Financing and performance agreements that mitigate risk</li>
        <li>Tilt-wall and metal building formats tailored to tenant use</li>
        <li>Flexible layouts — divisible bays or single-tenant shells</li>
        <li>Modern specifications: clear heights, ESFR sprinklers, dock ratios</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="feature-block">
      <h3>Market Context</h3>
      <p>The <strong>Texas Triangle</strong> is one of the nation’s fastest-growing industrial regions:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Houston:</strong> Port-driven demand in logistics, petrochemical, and medtech supply chains.</li>
        <li><strong>Dallas–Fort Worth:</strong> A national distribution hub with unmatched highway and rail connectivity.</li>
        <li><strong>Austin:</strong> Semiconductor and advanced manufacturing growth driving specialized industrial demand.</li>
        <li><strong>San Antonio:</strong> A cross-border logistics corridor shaped by NAFTA/USMCA trade flows.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>In these markets, ground-up development fills critical gaps where existing product cannot meet modern tenant requirements.</p>

    <p><strong>Pearl River Companies</strong> developed <strong>Stiles Lane</strong>, a 7.8-acre site at 13025 Stiles Ln in Sugar Land, into <strong>107,000 square feet of flex and light manufacturing space</strong>. With a capital investment of approximately $10 million, the project was supported by an economic development performance agreement with the City of Sugar Land, including reimbursements for infrastructure improvements.</p>
    <p>The development delivered modern tilt-wall space to a suburban market underserved by high-quality industrial product. By pairing strong tenant demand with public-private partnership support, Stiles Lane exemplifies how ground-up execution creates value in the Texas Triangle.</p>

<!-- Value Proposition -->
<section class="value">
  <div class="container">
    <h2>The Value of Ground-Up Industrial</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Class A Facilities:</strong> Premium rents and tenant stickiness from modern design.</li>
      <li><strong>Customization:</strong> Ability to deliver build-to-suit solutions for logistics, flex, or light manufacturing users.</li>
      <li><strong>Market Impact:</strong> Fill gaps in underserved corridors with durable, scalable product.</li>
      <li><strong>Scalable Upside:</strong> Unlike incremental repositioning, ground-up allows for transformational development.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>See how this strategy complements our <a href="/strategies/industrial/value-add/">Value-Add Industrial</a> and <a href="/strategies/retail/value-add/">Value-Add Retail</a> strategies, reinforced by the disciplined underwriting of <a href="/deal-studio/">Deal Studio</a> and proven outcomes in our <a href="/track-record/">Track Record</a>.</p>

<section class="container" aria-labelledby="gui-faq">
  <h2 id="gui-faq">Ground-Up Industrial — FAQs</h2>
  <div class="card">
    <h3>How does ground-up compare to value-add industrial?</h3>
    <p>Ground-up carries more risk due to the absence of in-place cash flows, but allows full customization and the ability to capture premium rents with Class A product. Value-add, by contrast, leverages existing income while pursuing upside through repositioning.</p>
    <h3>What building formats do you develop?</h3>
    <p>We deliver tilt-wall distribution centers, smaller-format metal buildings, and flex/light manufacturing facilities depending on market demand.</p>
    <h3>How do you mitigate construction risk?</h3>
    <p>Through disciplined site selection, tenant pre-leasing, and public-private partnerships such as performance agreements that support infrastructure costs.</p>
    <h3>Where do you invest?</h3>
    <p>Primarily the Texas Triangle — Houston, Dallas–Fort Worth, Austin, and San Antonio — with selective suburban submarkets where demand exceeds supply.</p>
