    <h1>Distressed Assets</h1>
    <p>Foreclosures, tax sales, government seizures, HOA liens, and bankruptcies — solved with speed, discipline, and clarity.</p>
  </div>

<!-- Main Content -->

  <div class="container">
    <h2>Our Approach</h2>
    <p>Distressed investing is where we cut our teeth. These situations demand <strong>speed, pattern recognition, and disciplined capital</strong>. We thrive under pressure — solving the puzzle when the clock is running down. With deep experience across <a href="/strategies/industrial/value-add/">value-add industrial</a>, government-seized property, HOA sales, mortgage foreclosures, and commercial workouts, we know how to separate traps from opportunity.</p>

    <div class="feature-block">
      <h3>Proven Track Record</h3>
      <p>We’ve executed dozens of distressed deals and underwritten thousands more. That volume builds recognition — knowing when distress is a dead end, and when it can be stabilized and repositioned for <a href="/track-record/">outsized returns</a>.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="feature-block alt">
      <h3>Our Playbook</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Acquire:</strong> Capital readiness to act decisively at foreclosure auctions, tax sales, and workouts.</li>
        <li><strong>Stabilize:</strong> Clear title issues, resolve liens, secure tenancy, and reintroduce assets to productive use.</li>
        <li><strong>Operate / Exit:</strong> Drive NOI via leasing or redevelopment, or exit cleanly into institutional demand.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="feature-block">
      <h3>Why It Matters</h3>
      <p>Distress is messy. Many avoid it. But disciplined operators know this is where asymmetric value is created. By moving with speed and certainty, we unlock opportunities others can’t touch — a repeatable advantage modeled inside <a href="/deal-studio/">Deal Studio</a>.</p>

    <h3>What types of distressed assets do you buy?</h3>
    <p>We’ve executed on government-seized property, tax foreclosure, HOA sales, mortgage foreclosures, and commercial bankruptcies.</p>
    <h3>How do you move so quickly?</h3>
    <p>Preparation and repetition. We underwrite thousands of deals, so when a live opportunity emerges we already know the playbook.</p>
    <h3>What makes distressed assets attractive?</h3>
    <p>They carry complexity others avoid, creating asymmetric upside. Title cleanup, re-tenanting, or redevelopment can unlock value overlooked by institutional buyers.</p>
    <h3>How does this tie into other strategies?</h3>
    <p>Distress complements our <a href="/strategies/industrial/value-add/">value-add industrial</a> and <a href="/strategies/retail/value-add/">value-add retail</a> focus, and is modeled systematically inside <a href="/deal-studio/">Deal Studio</a>.</p>
