<!-- Value of Mixed-Use Development -->
<section class="value">
  <div class="container">
    <h2>The Value of Mixed-Use Development</h2>
    <p>Mixed-use projects generate long-term value by aligning community needs with investor goals. 
       By combining retail, residential, office, and green space, these destinations become resilient, 
       adaptive, and enduring.</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Diversified Demand:</strong> Retail supports residents, residents support retail, and both drive demand for office and wellness uses.</li>
      <li><strong>Placemaking:</strong> Projects designed around human experience attract tenants and retain value through cultural relevance.</li>
      <li><strong>Growth Market Alignment:</strong> In high-growth regions like Central Texas, mixed-use captures the full spectrum of demand drivers.</li>
      <li><strong>Investor Upside:</strong> Integrated assets balance risk while enhancing yield compared to standalone product types.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>We view mixed-use not as a trend, but as a durable strategy. Our work in this area draws on lessons 
       from <a href="/strategies/retail/ground-up/">ground-up retail</a>, where strong fundamentals 
       create lasting destinations that anchor community life.</p>

    <h3>What makes a project “mixed-use”?</h3>
    <p>A mixed-use project integrates multiple property types — typically retail, residential, and office — into one cohesive environment. The goal is to create places where people can live, work, and play.</p>

    <h3>Why is mixed-use important for communities?</h3>
    <p>Mixed-use provides walkable convenience, activates public space, and fosters a stronger sense of place. It reduces reliance on cars and creates hubs where people naturally gather.</p>

    <p>By combining uses, investors gain diversified income streams and stronger tenant resilience. Retail tenants benefit from built-in foot traffic, while residential and office users enjoy added amenities.</p>

    <h3>Why Central Texas for mixed-use?</h3>
    <p>Markets like Bastrop and the greater Austin area are experiencing rapid population and job growth. Mixed-use developments capture this growth by meeting lifestyle expectations of both residents and employers.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Between 2022 and 2023, Bastrop city grew ~5.3%, with median household income rising ~19.5%.</li>
  <li>Bastrop County’s population is up ~13.9% since 2020 — ranking among Texas’s fastest-growing counties.</li>
  <li>Zip code 78602 is projected to grow nearly 39% by 2025, compared to the national average of ~4.7%.</li>
</ul>

<h3>What major employers are shaping the area?</h3>

  <li>SpaceX has a facility locally, and The Boring Company is nearby.</li>
  <li>An EdgeConneX data center is under development — with an investment of $440 million.</li>
</ul>

<h3>What film studio developments are coming to Bastrop?</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>204Texas</strong>: A $1.9 billion, 546-acre studio campus along the Colorado River, set to create ~747 jobs and $105 million/year economic impact. First phases complete by mid-2026.</li>
  <li><strong>Wyldwood Studios</strong>: A $100 million, 75-acre “film town” led by Zachary Levi — with sound stages, offices, amphitheaters, wellness and residential components. Groundbreaking late 2025; opening expected by 2027.</li>
